# CS3242 3D Modelling and Animation

## Intro and Modelling Pipeline

### Geometric Processing and Modelling Pipeline

1. Input data:
   1. Range-Scan
   2. CAD
   3. Tomography
2. Removal of topological and geometrical errors
3. Analysis of surface quality
4. Surface smoothing for noise removal
5. Parameterization
6. Simplification for complexity reduction
7. Re-meshing for improving mesh quality
8. Free-form and multi-resolution modelling
